## Weighted Finite Automata Learning Using Tensor Train

The repository contains experiments for approximating function with WFA using Tensor Train decomposition and spectral learning algorithm.

File `experiments.ipynb` runs and compares 2 algorithms:

* spectral learning algorithm
* Tensor Train decomposition and further automata extraction

## Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run experiments

Use `experiments.ipynb` to produce experiments results. Works in Google Colab.
